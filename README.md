## About Me

I'm a recent chemistry graduate who enjoys working on **AI, data science, and formal mathematics**. My background is firmly set in (analytical) chemistry, and through my studies and personal hobbies I transitioned into data science and math.
I'm currently contributing to formal mathematics projects using Lean, working on cutting-edge theorem proving alongside researchers worldwide.

For my bachelor's thesis, I built **Graph Neural Networks for NMR prediction**, including reproducible data pipelines and training setups on HPC clusters. Outside of chemistry, I like tackling complex data problems, from immigration statistics and COVID spread modeling to building small automated game solvers, working on Project Euler, and solving competitive programming puzzles on Codewars.

**Languages:** Fluent in Dutch 🇳🇱 and English 🇬🇧

## Current Science Work

### Formal Mathematics
- Contributing to [@AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd](https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd) — formalizing the Prime Number Theorem and related results in Lean
- Using AI-assisted proof tools like Aristotle, ChatGPT, and others to speed up proof development in Lean
- Working through parts of Project Euler by myself, a project focussing on computational math problems, from late highschool to advanced mathematics.

### AI & Research
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Designed depth-first search routines and custom dataset pipelines for molecular NMR prediction tasks
- **Deep Learning**: Experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch for bots in Rocket League, training Stable Diffusion LoRa's
- **Data Science**: Built personal projects around CBS data, vaccine risk modeling, water availability, and more
