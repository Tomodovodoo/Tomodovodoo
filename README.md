## About Me

I'm a recent chemistry graduate with a passion for **AI, data science, and formal mathematics**. My journey combines rigorous scientific training with deep technical expertise in machine learning and software development. I'm currently contributing to formal mathematics projects using Lean, working on cutting-edge theorem proving alongside researchers worldwide.

During my bachelor's thesis, I developed **Graph Neural Networks for NMR prediction**, building reproducible data pipelines and training models on HPC clusters. Beyond chemistry, I love solving complex data puzzles—from immigration analytics to COVID spread modeling to automated game solvers.

**Languages:** Fluent in Dutch 🇳🇱 and English 🇬🇧
